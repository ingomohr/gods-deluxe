                         GODS DELUXE
                        -------------

How to submit a bug:

- First, please read below before writing me about a bug. It is very likely to be on either of
  the lists below
- If the bug is not on the list, please report it
- If you witness any difference of behaviour with the original (example: difference in the puzzles),
  don't hesitate to report it. The exception being the monster AI,  because it is different from the
  original (I don't have the code!), but monsters involved in puzzles should not make the puzzle any
  different, even if original game seems to have a much more configurable A.I (probabilities, primary and
  secondary objectives, objective balance/probabilities, complex flying monsters A.I and Bezier trajectories...)
- Now that Kroah wrote the excellent Gods Level Viewer, there are no real secrets unrevealed in the game anymore:

TOTEST:


High-priority To Do
 
- jump: shift + button 2 (in the options / enhance the documentation)
- joystick DLL 32/64 bit
- the ability to fully configure graphics (I'd like to play full-screen at 1920x1080 4:3 or at least at 4:3 with unstretched graphics)
- in the original game you could hold down+left/right to dismount from a ladder (fall)
  you may want to check that feature out and whether you implement it.
- I just tried this remake. I was using the keyboard and found a small problem. I could not turn sideways
  in the top of ladders to throw knives like in the original DOS or Amiga version. I had to jump off the ladder.
- if you run the 'Windowed No Intro Doubled' game batch, it seems to apply some sort of
  graphics filter even if you set the graphics to Original, not as much as Scale2x,
  but it is still noticable, I don't know if that was your intention or not.
- level 3: 1 star remake: 8 hits to kill monsters, orig: 5
- original 17 fps framerate option for the ones who think that the remake is too smooth
- original game: shield in shop l2w3?
- HeroWeaponSet: rval -= ((rval>>1) - (rval>>2));, rval=15 should substract less, check disassembled code again
- snakes (level 2) sometimes stuck in walls (easy to reproduce in level 2-1, bonus section, or up the chimney)
- Can you please add support for the original PC Speaker sounds?

Not reproduced (to be confirmed):

- Tooltips/info for power pots in shop frequently incorrect/misleading.
  For example L2W3 shop at start displays price of 6k for 50% power pot when actual cost 17.5k. Another example is the shop at the end of L2/start of L3,
  where the costs for 50% and 100% power pots are displayed as 6k and 10k respectively.
  I know from the readme that you've done a lot of shuffling around with the prices of the power pots - just need the tooltips to be updated.
  (Love the new shop icon graphics btw, really big improvement from previous )
- in the reworked version the player sprite during stairs climb has a sprite with the back inverted horizontally... the black shade flashes to the wrong side.
- classic level 2 world 3: AI: monster jumping on platforms has not exactly the correct trajectory (same as above)
- If you fall off a ledge you can throw a weapon and the hero stops in the air 
  for a moment, maybe something for you to pick up.
  but aren't the weapons thrown when his arm comes down?	
- level 2? In the screen shots you will notice that cupboard is out of place. This was fine in 0.5
- fall on bump on the ceiling is too fast?

Medium/Low-priority To Do:

- full screen mode in Windows 10 sometimes remains black (was fixed for Windows 7, damn!)
- increase weapon power potions prices vary:
  l1w3 start : 6000  -
  l1w3 end   : 6000  -
  l2 (passwd): 20000 -
  l2w2 end   : 20000 32500
  l3 (passwd): 17500
  l4 (passwd): 17500
- add torch in 4am mix (thief lair) like Atari ST version has
- w1l3 speed bonus 210 & 280, spawn spikes on jump to 2nd part
- complete JOTD levels walkthrough
- editor: create new level: crash depending on MP3/music configuration
- able to change keyboard keys
- shield halo not centered on hero anymore
- flying AI: too far: target hero again
- die with 0 lives: sometimes no game over (not systematic)
- Ultron: in the reworked version the player sprite during stairs climb has a sprite with the back inverted horizontally... the black shade flashes to the wrong side.
- if dies when taking an object, the object is lost (can be blocking)
- take object when thief aims to it: no aim reset until object is dropped again
- fade uniformity problem (letters, windows)
- Also the menu\highscore change way to fast
- ultron: Don't the knifes go to deep into the enemy (look like collision is in the center), this is mostly aesthethic.
- ultron: The same seems to happen vertically, with witches, and if it's too high or too low, the knife will trespass them without killing.
- ultron: When you fall of a platform, by walking off the edge, it moves horizontally, as if it had jumped, i think in the game you just fell down.
- Ultron: Are you sure also the animation of the movememt isn't a bit to fast... it's very small... but the impression in me is that the animation is always a bit too fast... (not the movement by pixels on screen)
- Ultron: Does the engine support the png's alpha mapping or just does masking? It'd be useful for real shadows on the items (opposed to the current full black), maybe a flickering light overlay radius on the candles, and would even allow antialiasing all moving sprites to the background on the fly (if GFX worked\redone)  ;) 
- editor: add trigger association: assoc not redrawed
- platform + ladder: no fall (jotd level 1 end)
- jerky when scrolling on ladders
- can cross walls sometimes (l1 w3 near teleport door between spikes)
- boss level 3 decent screen shake
- add "object to avoid" in parameters (textfield) to get rid of specifics for classic level 4
- classic level 2 world 2: AI: gem monster jumps, does not fall
- unarmed familiar should attack monsters horizontally not vertically
- some nice alpha blended glows next to explosion and item takings.
  
Minor To Do:

- increase power of bomb -> higher explosion and stars (test at level 4)
- magic axe/bomb/hunter shot and no other weapon, hero is still trying to shoot
 (but who would select such lousy weapon combination ?)
- exploding particles for boss level 1
- AI: test 5: monster does not jump on hero until reached wall (AI limitation)
- editor: (replace code-driven stuff): shop editor and shopkeeper token association + shopkeeper direction + shop Y/N in beginning of a level
- editor: default weapons for temporary start
- editor: if no class for level & copperbar then looping exception
- changing locale during the game is not working 100%
- in the PC version, when waiting in the main menu for some time, there would run a
  demo of the levels. (some recordings of play).
